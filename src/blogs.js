        "Content":"My name is Allan Munene. I started Mount Kenya University back in September 2021. When I joined i started pursuing Laboratory Technology but my passion was in IT related courses. I tried changing the course in the first semester but it was unsuccesfull. However in the begining of the next semester, my request to join BIT was accepted by the HOD and the dean of students. I started afresh in my new course and liked it alot. I went further to obtain IT knowledge from other sources like stackup where I beleive it's the ideal place for any developer. I see my self in the next 5 years as an IT expert running a big enterprise. At the same time, am trying to escape the Matrix as stated by Andrew Tate."

        "Content": "I started Learning web3 back in 2021. I would say that the content was presented to me at an ideal time, that is after learning abit of web2, I was already equiped with the knowledge of Javascript, HTML and CSS. In this case, onboarding to web3 and blockchain technology was not a difficult task for me. Over the years, I've come to like web3, its applications and I enjoing developing on it. At the same time, i also encourage people to adopt to this technology as it is the future. I also encourage young developers to venture in web3, in this way, we can make this thing great and better the lives of people through decentralization"
